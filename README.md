## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap 5
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I have been only learning HTML and CSS for a month. So the challenge for me was to make the card responsive and have it centered on the screen, getting as close to the design template as possible. At the beginning I did not know how to make the product image switch to the mobile version, but after doing some research I found that the <picture> element does the job. 

### Continued development

I need to practice and improve my positioning and gain a better feel on how divs and move around with relation to each other. I would like to get to the level where it comes naturally and I can place every object where I want with ease.

### Useful resources

The frontendmentor slack group gave me some valuable advice.
